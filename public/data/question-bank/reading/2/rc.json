      "passageText": "In autumn, leaves change from green to beautiful colors like red, orange, and yellow. But why does this happen? Leaves are green because of chlorophyll. Chlorophyll helps plants make food from sunlight. In fall, there is less sunlight. The chlorophyll breaks down and goes away. Without the green chlorophyll, we can see other colors that were hiding in the leaves all along. Yellow and orange colors were always there. Red colors are made when sugars get trapped in the leaves. Different trees make different colors. Oak trees turn red and brown. Maple trees can be bright orange or red. Aspen trees turn golden yellow. The shorter days and cooler nights of autumn create this colorful show.",

      "passageText": "Hurricanes are powerful storms that form over warm ocean water. They can be very dangerous. A hurricane starts when warm, moist air rises from the ocean. As this air goes up, it leaves an area of low pressure below. More air rushes in to fill the space, and this air also rises. This pattern makes the air spin. If conditions are right, the storm gets stronger and becomes a hurricane. Hurricanes have strong winds that spin around a center called the eye. The eye is surprisingly calm. Around the eye, winds can blow faster than 157 miles per hour! Hurricanes bring heavy rain and can cause floods. Scientists use satellites and planes to track hurricanes. This helps people know when to stay safe or leave their homes.",

Most bats are nocturnal, meaning they are active at night. Bats help us in many ways. Some bats eat insects. A single bat can eat over 1,000 mosquitoes in one night! This helps control bug populations. Other bats eat fruit and spread seeds. This helps new plants grow in forests. Some bats drink nectar from flowers and spread pollen, just like bees. Without bats, many plants could not make seeds. Bats use echolocation to find food in the dark. They make sounds that bounce off objects and return to their ears. This tells them where things are. Bats are important members of our ecosystems.",

      "passageText": "Bridges help us cross rivers, valleys, and roads. But how do they stay up? All bridges must handle two forces: compression and tension. Compression is a pushing force that squeezes things together. Tension is a pulling force that stretches things. Different bridges handle these forces in different ways. Beam bridges are the simplest. A flat surface rests on supports at each end. The supports handle the weight by pushing down. Arch bridges curve upward. The curved shape pushes forces outward to the ground. Arch bridges have been built for thousands of years. Suspension bridges hang from cables attached to tall towers. The cables are in tension—they are being pulled. The Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco is a famous suspension bridge. Engineers choose which type of bridge to build based on what needs to be crossed.",

He became the first Black student at his college. Later, he became a famous professor. Carver saw that many Southern farmers were struggling. They had planted cotton for so many years that the soil was worn out. Carver found a solution: peanuts! Peanut plants put nutrients back into the soil. But there was a problem. Farmers didn't want to grow peanuts because no one would buy them. So Carver invented over 300 uses for peanuts—including dyes, plastics, and even gasoline! He also found uses for sweet potatoes and pecans. Thanks to Carver, farmers could make money and heal their land at the same time.",

These plates float on hot, melted rock below. The plates move very slowly—about as fast as your fingernails grow. Sometimes plates push against each other. They can get stuck. Pressure builds up. When the plates suddenly slip and move, an earthquake happens! The place underground where the plates slip is called the focus. The spot directly above it on the surface is called the epicenter. The epicenter usually has the strongest shaking. Scientists use machines called seismographs to measure earthquakes. The strength is measured on a scale. Small earthquakes happen every day around the world. Most are so small that people don't feel them. Large earthquakes can cause buildings to fall and create cracks in the ground.",

Carlos froze. \"I've seen you watching,\" she said kindly. \"Would you like to see the garden?\" Carlos walked around the wall and through her gate. Mrs. Kim showed him everything.

Scientists have watched them solve puzzles and open jars to get food. They can even recognize different people! One of the octopus's most amazing abilities is camouflage. It can change its color and texture in less than a second. It does this to hide from predators or sneak up on prey. If camouflage doesn't work, the octopus has another trick. It can squirt ink to confuse enemies. The ink creates a dark cloud that lets the octopus escape. An octopus can also squeeze through incredibly tiny spaces. Because it has no bones, it can fit through any hole larger than its beak. An octopus the size of a soccer ball can squeeze through a hole the size of a quarter!",

One big threat is plastic pollution. Sea turtles sometimes mistake plastic bags for jellyfish, their favorite food. Eating plastic can make them very sick. Many beaches now ban plastic bags to help. Another problem is that turtles nest on beaches that have been built up with hotels and houses. Bright lights from buildings confuse baby turtles. They crawl toward the lights instead of the ocean. Volunteers protect nests and turn off lights during nesting season. Climate change also affects sea turtles. The temperature of sand determines whether eggs become male or female turtles. Warmer temperatures mean more females are born. Scientists are studying how to help balance this. Everyone can help by reducing plastic use and supporting protected beaches.",

Marco tried. Oranges flew everywhere. \"Dancing?\" Marco stepped on his own feet. \"Magic tricks?\" The cards scattered across the floor. Marco felt hopeless. That night, he helped his dad make dinner. He chopped vegetables perfectly while telling jokes that made his dad laugh. \"Marco,\" his dad said, \"you have many talents. You're kind, funny, and a great helper. Not all talents belong on a stage.\" Marco thought about this. On talent show day, he volunteered to help backstage. He made nervous performers laugh. He found lost costumes. He cheered everyone on. After the show, the principal thanked him. \"The show couldn't have happened without you,\" she said. Marco smiled. Helping others was his talent.",

Ancient Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans all ate similar foods. However, modern pizza came from Italy. In the 1800s, poor people in Naples, Italy, needed cheap, quick food. They put tomatoes, cheese, and other toppings on flatbread. In 1889, a baker named Raffaele Esposito made a special pizza for Queen Margherita of Italy. He used tomatoes, mozzarella cheese, and basil—red, white, and green like the Italian flag. The queen loved it! This pizza is still called Margherita pizza today. Italian immigrants brought pizza to America in the late 1800s. The first American pizzeria opened in New York City in 1905. After World War II, pizza became popular across America. Soldiers who had been to Italy wanted pizza when they came home. Today, about 5 billion pizzas are sold around the world every year!",
