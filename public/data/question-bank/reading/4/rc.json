Edison went on to become one of the greatest inventors in history. His most famous invention was the practical light bulb. Before Edison, people used candles and gas lamps for light. Edison worked tirelessly, testing over a thousand different materials before finding one that would glow for many hours. He also invented the phonograph, which could record and play back sound. Edison's laboratory in Menlo Park, New Jersey, became known as an 'invention factory.' He believed that 'genius is one percent inspiration and ninety-nine percent perspiration.'",

The sun heats water in oceans, lakes, and rivers, causing it to evaporate and rise into the air as water vapor. As this vapor rises higher, it cools and condenses into tiny droplets that form clouds. When these droplets combine and become heavy enough, they fall back to Earth as precipitation - rain, snow, sleet, or hail. The water then collects in bodies of water or soaks into the ground, where plants absorb it through their roots. Eventually, the water evaporates again, and the cycle continues. This process has been happening for billions of years and is essential for all life on Earth.",

These delicate insects travel up to 3,000 miles from Canada and the United States to the warm forests of central Mexico. Unlike birds, no single butterfly makes the complete round trip. The butterflies that fly south in autumn are the great-great-grandchildren of those that left Mexico the previous spring. Scientists are still amazed by how monarchs navigate so precisely to a place they have never been. They believe monarchs use the position of the sun and Earth's magnetic field as guides. In Mexico, the butterflies cluster together on trees to survive the cool mountain nights. When spring arrives, they begin the journey north again.",

When pressure builds up underground, the magma pushes upward, looking for a way to escape. A volcano forms where magma breaks through Earth's crust. When a volcano erupts, the magma that flows onto the surface is called lava. Volcanic eruptions can be gentle, with lava slowly oozing out, or violent, with explosions that shoot ash and rock miles into the sky. Some of the world's most fertile farmland is found near volcanoes because volcanic ash adds rich minerals to the soil. However, living near an active volcano can also be dangerous.",

Arachne became proud of her talent. 'I am the greatest weaver in the world,' she boasted. 'Even the goddess Athena could not match my skill.' When Athena heard this, she disguised herself as an old woman and warned Arachne to be humble. But Arachne only boasted more. Athena revealed herself and challenged Arachne to a contest. Both wove magnificent tapestries, but Athena was furious that a mortal dared compare herself to a goddess. She transformed Arachne into a spider, destined to weave forever. Today, spiders are called arachnids after Arachne.",

Over ten years, Tubman made approximately nineteen dangerous trips back to the South. She guided about seventy people to freedom, including her elderly parents.

      "passageText": "An ecosystem is a community of living things interacting with each other and their environment. Every organism plays an important role. Producers, like plants and algae, make their own food using sunlight. Consumers, like rabbits and wolves, eat other organisms for energy. Decomposers, like mushrooms and bacteria, break down dead matter and return nutrients to the soil. These roles are connected like links in a chain. If one link is removed, the whole chain can fall apart. For example, if wolves disappear from a forest, deer populations may grow too large and eat too many plants. This can lead to soil erosion and fewer homes for other animals. Protecting ecosystems means understanding how all the pieces fit together.",

Solar energy captures power from the sun using special panels that convert sunlight into electricity. Wind energy uses large turbines - like modern windmills - to generate power when the wind turns their blades. These energy sources are called renewable because they won't run out. The sun will keep shining, and the wind will keep blowing. Many countries are now building large solar and wind farms. Some experts believe that by 2050, most of our electricity could come from renewable sources. The challenge is storing this energy for times when the sun isn't shining or the wind isn't blowing.",

Finally, he found the pearl guarded by an ancient dragon. 'What do you wish for?' the dragon asked. Chen Li thought of all the things he could ask for - gold, power, eternal life. But he remembered his suffering village. 'I wish for rain to save my people,' he said. The dragon smiled. 'You have chosen wisely. A selfless wish is the most powerful of all.'

Octopuses can also change their skin color and texture in milliseconds, helping them camouflage against predators or communicate with other octopuses.

      "passageText": "Mia found a crumpled note on the playground. It was the answer key to tomorrow's math test, and she recognized the handwriting - it belonged to her best friend, Lily. Mia's stomach churned. She knew Lily had been struggling in math and was desperate for a good grade. But cheating was wrong. Mia spent all night thinking about what to do. She imagined Lily getting caught and facing serious consequences. She also thought about what kind of friend she wanted to be. The next morning, Mia found Lily before class. 'I found this,' she said gently. 'You don't need it. I'll help you study instead.' Tears filled Lily's eyes. 'Thank you for being honest with me,' she whispered. 'That's what real friends do.'",

      "passageText": "Earth's surface is not one solid piece. Instead, it is made up of large sections called tectonic plates that fit together like a giant puzzle. These plates float on hot, melted rock deep underground and are constantly moving, though very slowly. When plates push against each other, pull apart, or slide past one another, pressure builds up along the edges. Eventually, this pressure releases suddenly, causing the ground to shake. This shaking is called an earthquake. The place underground where the earthquake starts is called the focus, and the spot directly above it on the surface is the epicenter. Scientists use instruments called seismographs to measure earthquake strength. Understanding how earthquakes work helps communities prepare for these powerful natural events.",
