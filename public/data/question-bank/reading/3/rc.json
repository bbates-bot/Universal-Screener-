When the droplets get heavy enough, they fall back to Earth as precipitation. Precipitation can be rain, snow, sleet, or hail. Some water flows into rivers and streams. Some soaks into the ground.

Bees communicate through a special 'waggle dance.' When a bee finds good flowers, it returns to the hive and dances. The dance tells other bees exactly where to find the flowers!

He saw nothing but was too proud to admit it. On parade day, he walked through the streets in his 'new clothes.' People cheered to avoid looking stupid. Then a child shouted, 'But he has nothing on!'

This was not a real railroad. It was a secret network of safe houses that helped enslaved people escape to freedom. Tubman made about thirteen trips back to the South. She risked her life to guide about seventy people to freedom, including her elderly parents. She was never caught and never lost a passenger.

When there is too much pressure, magma pushes up through cracks in Earth's crust. This is called a volcanic eruption. Once magma reaches the surface, it is called lava. Lava can be as hot as 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit! It flows down the sides of the volcano, destroying everything in its path. Volcanoes can also shoot ash, rocks, and gases high into the sky. Some eruptions are slow and gentle. Others are violent explosions. Scientists called volcanologists study volcanoes. They use special tools to predict when a volcano might erupt. This helps keep people safe. There are about 1,500 active volcanoes on Earth today.",

The young crab tried to walk straight, but she could not. Her legs would only move sideways. 'Mother,' she said, 'please show me how. Walk straight ahead, and I will follow your example.' The mother crab tried to walk straight forward. But her own legs only moved sideways too! She could not walk any differently than her daughter. The mother crab was embarrassed. She had criticized her daughter for something she could not do herself. She learned that you should not ask others to do things that you cannot do yourself.",

Most penguins live in the Southern Hemisphere, where it is very cold. To stay warm, they have waterproof feathers and a thick layer of fat called blubber. Emperor penguins are the largest, standing almost four feet tall. They survive the coldest winters on Earth in Antarctica. Penguins are social animals. They live in large groups called colonies. Some colonies have thousands of penguins! Parents take turns keeping their eggs warm and finding food. Penguin chicks are covered in fluffy down feathers.

First, you chew food into small pieces. Saliva starts breaking it down in your mouth. The food travels to your stomach, where acids and muscles mash it up. Then it moves to your small intestine. Here, nutrients are absorbed into your blood. Your blood carries these nutrients all over your body. Carbohydrates give you energy to run and play. Proteins help you grow and repair muscles. Fats store energy for later and keep you warm. Vitamins and minerals keep your bones, skin, and organs healthy. The leftover waste exits your body. Your digestive system works all day long!",

She was so small no one noticed her. She spun a web all the way to the sun and took a tiny piece. She put it in a clay pot and carried it back home. 'Do not look at the treasure until we are home,' she warned. But Coyote was curious and opened the pot. Light burst out and flew into the sky! That is how the sun was placed so high above us.

Some places have plenty of water, while other areas face droughts. Conservation means using water wisely so there is enough for everyone. You can conserve water in many ways. Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth. Take shorter showers. Water plants in the morning when it is cool. Fix leaky faucets. If everyone saves a little water, it adds up to a lot!

When your part of Earth faces the sun, you have daytime. The sun lights up the sky and keeps you warm. When your part of Earth turns away from the sun, you have night. The sky becomes dark, and you can see the moon and stars. While you sleep at night, people on the other side of Earth are having daytime! Earth also travels around the sun in a big circle. This trip takes one year. As Earth moves through the year, the amount of daylight changes. Summer days are longer because your part of Earth tilts toward the sun. Winter days are shorter because your part tilts away from the sun. [Diagram showing Earth's rotation and the sun's light]",

The weeds will be short and brown. Then you can easily separate them.' The farmer listened. He let the wheat and weeds grow together. At harvest time, just as the woman had said, he could easily tell them apart. He gathered all the good wheat and threw away the weeds.

The Wright Brothers, Orville and Wilbur, invented the first successful airplane in 1903. Their flight lasted only 12 seconds but changed the world forever. Marie Curie discovered new elements and invented ways to use X-rays. Her work helps doctors see inside our bodies. Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone in 1876. Now people could talk to each other from far away! All these inventors had something in common. They did not give up when things got hard. They kept trying until they found solutions.
